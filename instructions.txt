To start the app:

1. Open Compass to access the MongoDB and start a connection by clicking "Fill in connection fields individually".
2. In this page, if it says localhost in the Hostname field, you can leave the port default as well and click "Connect" to create the connection.
3. Create a database with the name "usermanagermongodb" and the collection with the name "users" by clicking "Create Database" in the top left.
4. Go into the database and then the collection you've just created and 
#. Once you have the file cloned from github, open up the terminal and type "npm i" to install all dependencies.
#. Afterwards in the terminal, type node app.js or nodemon app.js 
    (Node would work better due to the server restarting when users are created with nodemon.)
